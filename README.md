# Predictive-Modelling-for-Cancer-Susceptibility
This project is a healthcare-based predictive system designed to estimate the future risk of sporadic Colorectal Cancer using a stochastic mathematical model of somatic mutations in key driver genes. It provides a personalised 5–10 year risk assessment to support early detection and preventive clinical decision-making.
